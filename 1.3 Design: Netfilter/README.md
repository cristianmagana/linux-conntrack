# Design: Netfilter

Connction tracking in Linux kernel is implemented as a module in Netfilter framework. <br>

Netfilter is a packet manipulating and filtering framework inside the kernel. It provides several hooking points inside the kernel, so packet hooking, filtering and many other processings could be done.

> Put it more clearly, hooking is a mechanism that places several checking points in the travesal path of packets. When a packet arrives a hooking > point, it first gets checked, and the checking result could be one of:
>
> 1. let it go: no modifications to the packet, push it back to the original travesal path and let it go
> 2. modify it: e.g. replace network address (NAT), then push back to the original travesal path and let it go
> 3. drop it: e.g. by firewall rules configured at this checking (hooking) point <br>

> **Note that conntrack module only extracts connection information and maintains its database, it does not modify or drop a packet. Modification and dropping are done by other modules, e.g. NAT.**

Netfilter is one of the earliest networking frameworks inside Linux kernel, it initially got developed in 1998, and merged into 2.4.x kernel mainline in 2000.

After more than 20 yearsâ€™ evolvement, it gets so complicated that results to degraded performance in certain scenarios, we will talk a little more about this later.
